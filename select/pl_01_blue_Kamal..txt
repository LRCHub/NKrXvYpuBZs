Nikes on my feet,
but you don't check up on me
Bite my bottom lip until
it's blue
Steadily unloadin'
all your stress upon me
But I don't ever
put my shit on you
You only want shout me
on the weekend
Even when you keep
your options open
You're the one that threw me
in the deep end
Watching me,
you know I'm barely floatin'
You want me to beg
for your attention
You want me to beg you
for your time
You don't want to show me
no affection
But you want me to show
you all of mine
Curiosity, you want me
to be everything you need
But you out of line
You know I need peace of mind,
yeah
It's all
I've been lookin' to find
Distracted
by the surface of your skin
The melodies you sing
The memories you spin
I'm so lost in everything
That makes you
All the details
of your delicate design
Awkward nights and days
ain't lookin' better on me
Buggin' over things
I thought I knew
Drag me down
while I'm vulnerable
Excuse yourself
'cause you've been hurtin' too
I feel guilty every time
we're meetin'
Sick of all the words
I'm sugar coatin'
Bury my emotions,
I ain't speakin'
Watchin' me you know
I'm barely copin'
You want me to beg
for your attention
You want me to beg you
for your time
You don't want to show me
no affection
But you want me to show
you all of mine
Curiosity,
you want me
to be everything you need
But you out of line
You know I need peace of mind,
yeah
It's all
I've been lookin' to find
Distracted
by the surface of your skin
The melodies you sing
The memories you spin
I'm so lost in everything
That makes you
All the details
of your delicate design
Distracted
by the surface of your skin
The melodies you sing
The memories you spin
I'm so lost in everything
That makes you
All the details
of your delicate design
You want me to beg
for your attention
You want me to beg you
for your time
You don't want to show me
no affection
But you want me to show
you all of mine
Curiosity,
you want me
to be everything you need

You know I need peace of mind,

It's all
I've been lookin' to find
